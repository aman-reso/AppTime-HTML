        <p>Welcome to AppTime (also referred to as "ScreenTime", "we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we collect, use, and safeguard your information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and usage when you use our application.</p>
        
        <div class="prominent-disclosure">
            <h2>⚠️ PROMINENT DISCLOSURE - DATA COLLECTION AND SHARING</h2>
            <div class="disclosure-text">
                <p><strong>AppTime collects, transmits, syncs, and stores your Installed Application information (including application names, package identifiers, and usage statistics) to enable screen time tracking and app usage analytics features, when you use the app to monitor your device usage patterns.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Specifically, AppTime:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collects</strong> information about all applications installed on your device, including application names and package identifiers</li>
                    <li><strong>Transmits</strong> this Installed Application information to our servers to provide cloud sync, backup, and cross-device analytics features</li>
                    <li><strong>Stores</strong> your Installed Application information both locally on your device and on our secure servers</li>
                    <li><strong>Uses</strong> this data to generate usage reports, provide personalized insights, and improve app functionality</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This data collection is essential for the core functionality of AppTime. By using this app, you consent to the collection, transmission, storage, and use of your Installed Application information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>You have the right to opt-out of data transmission at any time through the app settings, though this may limit certain features such as cloud backup and cross-device synchronization.</strong></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Installed Application Information</h3>

            <li>Frequency of app usage</li>
            <li>Session duration and patterns</li>
            <li>Device information (model, operating system version)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This usage data is linked to your Installed Application information and may be transmitted to our servers for analytics and cloud sync purposes.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Device Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect certain device information to ensure compatibility and improve our services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device model and manufacturer</li>
            <li>Operating system version</li>
            <li>Device identifiers (anonymized)</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Crash reports and error logs</li>
            <li>Performance metrics</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        
        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Functionality:</strong> To provide screen time tracking and app usage statistics</li>
            <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> To analyze usage patterns and enhance user experience</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Support:</strong> To diagnose and resolve technical issues</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> To detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and security threats</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Data Storage, Transmission, and Security</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Data Transmission</h3>
        <p><strong>AppTime transmits your Installed Application information and app usage data to our secure servers.</strong> This transmission occurs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you first launch the app (to sync your installed applications)</li>
            <li>Periodically to keep your data synchronized across devices</li>
            <li>When you enable cloud backup features</li>
            <li>To provide analytics and usage insights</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data transmission is encrypted using industry-standard SSL/TLS protocols to ensure secure transfer.</p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Data Storage</h3>
        <p>Your data is stored in two locations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> On your device for immediate access and offline functionality</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> On our secure servers to enable backup, sync, and cross-device access</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can control cloud storage through app settings. Disabling cloud sync will prevent data transmission to our servers, but local functionality will continue to work.</p>
        
        <h3>3.3 Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>End-to-end encryption for data in transit</li>
            <li>Encryption at rest for data stored on our servers</li>
            <li>Secure local storage mechanisms</li>
            <li>Regular security assessments and audits</li>
            <li>Access controls and authentication protocols</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.4 Data Retention</h3>
        <p>Your Installed Application information and app usage data are retained:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Locally:</strong> According to your device storage and app settings</li>
            <li><strong>On Servers:</strong> Until you delete your account or request data deletion, or as required by law</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can delete your data at any time through the application settings or by contacting us directly.</p>
